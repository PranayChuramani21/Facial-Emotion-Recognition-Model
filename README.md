# Facial Emotion Recognition Model
This project is based on an advanced model with the ability to predict the facial emotion of a person in an image.

### Description
Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is the technology that analyses facial expressions from both static images and videos in order to reveal information on one’s emotional state.

Facial Emotion Recognition is a technology used for analysing sentiments by different sources, such as pictures and videos. It belongs to the family of technologies often referred to as ‘affective computing’, a multidisciplinary field of research on computer’s capabilities to recognise and interpret human emotions and affective states and it often builds on Artificial Intelligence technologies.
